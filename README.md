Minecraft snapshot 21w07a added Deepslate, right?
Right?
No! It added Grimstone! 

Grimstone was renamed and slightly retextured to Deepslate over the next few snapshots after that as Mojang didn't think "grimstone" fit well with the vibe of what the deeper
stuff actually was, so they renamed it to Deepslate.

But if you're like me, you think Grimstone was a cooler name, and you want that name to be changed! This pack is the solution for you.
